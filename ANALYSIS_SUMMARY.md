```bash
npm update vitest @vitest/coverage-v8
```

#### 2. Axios Vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.5)
**Risk**: SSRF attacks and DoS via data size exploitation  
**Fix**: Update axios (transitive dependency) to >= v1.12.0  
```bash
npm audit fix
```

### 🟡 Code Security Strengths

#### ✅ Cryptography

- Buffer boundary checking

#### ✅ Attack Prevention
- **Replay Attacks**: Prevented via sequence numbers (seqno) and chain IDs
- **Code Injection**: No eval() or Function() usage
- **Buffer Overflows**: Proper Uint8Array handling (124 instances reviewed)
- **Type Confusion**: Strong TypeScript typing

#### ✅ Authentication
- ECDSA signature verification
- Message signing with Poseidon hash
- Proper separation of auth data

### 🔸 Areas for Improvement

1. **Dependency Updates**: 14 vulnerabilities across dependencies
2. **Security Documentation**: Now added (SECURITY.md)
3. **Key Storage Guidance**: Best practices documented
4. **Rate Limiting**: Should be implemented by users
5. **Audit Trail**: No public security audit reports
